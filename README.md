## Build status ##

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/italankin/dictionary.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/italankin/dictionary)

## Install ##

You can get app from [Google Play page](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.italankin.dictionary). APKs also can be found at [releases](https://github.com/italankin/dictionary/releases) tab in the `Downloads` section.

## Supported languages ##

Everything is backed by [Yandex.Dictionary](https://tech.yandex.com/dictionary/). Check out their [page](https://tech.yandex.com/dictionary/doc/dg/concepts/api-overview-docpage/) to find more information about supported languages and features.

## Configuration ##

Configuration parameters are located in `app/config` folder. Sample debug configuration file is provided, which looks like this:
```properties
baseUrl         = "https://dictionary.yandex.net/api/v1/dicservice.json/"
apiKey          = "myApiKey"
keystore        = path/to/keystore
keystorePasswd  = somePassword
alias           = someAlias
aliasPasswd     = someAliasPassword
```
It's highly recommended to change `apiKey` field with _your_ API key. You can get the free one [here](https://tech.yandex.com/keys/get/?service=dict).
